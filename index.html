    <a><br>I am 12 y.o. and i am in love with my classmate. 
      she didn't notice me for a long time, but one day 
      she accidentally began to message me. i was happy, 
      but suffered. i covered in sweat each time i got a 
      message from her. i was really scared to seem illiterate, 
      my replies were monosyllabic, though I wanted much more. 
      lord, even now these dry answers humiliate me in my own eyes. 
      <br><br>

      interest in my answers. returning home i sobbed bitterly
